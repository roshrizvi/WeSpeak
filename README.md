## WeSpeak

WeSpeak is a project that aims to bridge the current communication gap faced by speach-impared people by interpreting Indian Sign Language (ISL) in real-time using machine learning and image processing.

This project was the winner of the PCCE "IDEAS 2024" competition, where it secured First place among 30+ other projects. 
It is one of the few projects to be selected by CIBA (Centre for Incubation & Business Acceleration) to be taken to the next level and is now being further developed and expanded upon in CIBA.

## Key Features

- **Indian Sign Language Interpretation For Letters:** WeSpeak interprets individual letters in the Indian Sign Language using machine learning and image processing so that the user can spell out a word letter-by-letter.
- **Sign Language Interpretation For Words:** WeSpeak offers real-time interpretation for words gestured out in sign language, bridging the communucation gap that currently exisyts and aiding communication for the speach-impaired.
- **Sign Language Learning:** Users can learn Indian Sign Language through interactive modules and exercises provided by WeSpeak.

## Additional Features
- **Hands-Free Presentation Control:** Utilizing image processing technology, WeSpeak offers a hands-free presentation control feature that can be utilized in schools, colleges, meeting rooms, and other institutions.
- **Volume Control:** Using the same hand tracking technology used for the sign language interpretation, we can control many other features without the need of a physical interface. This is one of the examples as a proof-of-concept.
- **Snake Game with Gesture Control:** To show how quick and responsive our hand tracking technology is, WeSpeak includes a fun snake game that uses hands-free image processing technology to control the snake on screen, making it an interactive and enjoyable experience.
